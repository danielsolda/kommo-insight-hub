# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages is currently set to "Deploy from a branch" which tries to use Jekyll, but this is a React/Vite SPA that should use GitHub Actions.

## The Solution
You need to change your GitHub Pages source to use GitHub Actions:

### Steps to Fix:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under "Build and deployment"
5. Change **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
6. Save the changes

### What This Does:
- Uses the existing `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow
- Builds the Vite app correctly 
- Deploys the built files to GitHub Pages
- Handles SPA routing with the `.nojekyll` file

### After Making This Change:
- Push any commit to the `main` branch
- The GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically
- Your app will be deployed correctly to GitHub Pages

The code is already properly configured - you just need to change the deployment source setting.
